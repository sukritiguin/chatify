To effectively utilize this schema, it's important to understand how various operations interact with the tables. Below are common use-cases and the logical flow involved in each.

### A. Creating a Test

**Steps**:

1. **Create Test Entry**:

   - Insert a new record into the `tests` table with relevant details (title, description, duration, etc.).
2. **Define Sections**:

   - For each section in the test, insert records into the `sections` table linked to the `testId`.
3. **Add Questions**:

   - For each section, insert questions into the `questions` table, specifying the `sectionId` and `type`.
   - Optionally, link questions to a `questionBankId` for reuse.
4. **Add Options (for Objective Questions)**:

   - For each objective question (MCQ, MSQ, TrueFalse), insert corresponding options into the `options` table linked to the `questionId`.
5. **Tag Questions**:

   - Insert relevant tags into the `questionTags` table for each question to aid in categorization.
6. **Configure Test Settings**:

   - Insert key-value pairs into the `testSettings` table to configure test-specific parameters.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Creating a new test
const newTest = {
  title: "Professional Certification Exam",
  description: "Assessment for professional certification.",
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  createdBy: adminUserId,
  duration: 120,
  isActive: true,
  accessType: "private",
  maxAttempts: 3,
  passScore: 70.0,
  randomizedQuestions: true,
  randomizedOptions: true,
  testVersion: "v1.0",
  tags: ["Certification", "Professional"],
  instructions: "Please read all instructions carefully before starting the test.",
};

// Insert into tests table
const testId = await db.insert("tests", newTest);

// Adding a section
const newSection = {
  testId: testId,
  title: "Section 1: Technical Knowledge",
  instructions: "Answer all questions in this section.",
  sectionOrder: 1,
  duration: 60,
  isMandatory: true,
};

const sectionId = await db.insert("sections", newSection);

// Adding a question
const newQuestion = {
  sectionId: sectionId,
  type: "MCQ",
  questionText: "What is the capital of France?",
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  order: 1,
  isActive: true,
  points: 5.0,
  hints: ["It's also known as the city of love."],
  attachments: [],
};

const questionId = await db.insert("questions", newQuestion);

// Adding options
const option1 = {
  questionId: questionId,
  optionText: "Paris",
  isCorrect: true,
  optionOrder: 1,
  feedback: "Correct! Paris is the capital of France.",
};

const option2 = {
  questionId: questionId,
  optionText: "Lyon",
  isCorrect: false,
  optionOrder: 2,
  feedback: "Incorrect. Lyon is a major city, but not the capital.",
};

// Insert options
await db.insert("options", option1);
await db.insert("options", option2);

// Tagging the question
const tag1 = {
  questionId: questionId,
  tag: "Geography",
};

await db.insert("questionTags", tag1);
```

### B. Assigning a Test to Candidates

**Steps**:

1. **Select Candidates**:

   - Determine which candidates (`users`) should be assigned the test.
2. **Create Test Assignment**:

   - Insert records into the `testAssignments` table linking the `testId` with each `candidateId`.
   - Set `assignedAt`, `dueDate`, and initial `status` as "assigned".
3. **Notify Candidates**:

   - Use the existing `notifications` system to inform candidates about their assignments.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Assigning test to multiple candidates
const candidates = [userId1, userId2, userId3];
const dueDate = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(); // 7 days from now

for (const candidateId of candidates) {
  const assignment = {
    testId: testId,
    candidateId: candidateId,
    assignedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    dueDate: dueDate,
    status: "assigned",
    attemptCount: 0,
  };
  
  const assignmentId = await db.insert("testAssignments", assignment);
  
  // Create a notification
  const notification = {
    userId: candidateId,
    type: "test_assigned",
    referenceId: assignmentId,
    referenceType: "testAssignments",
    fromUserId: adminUserId,
    metadata: {
      message: `You have been assigned the test "${newTest.title}".`,
      actionUrl: `/tests/${testId}/start`,
    },
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    isRead: false,
  };
  
  await db.insert("notifications", notification);
}
```

### C. Taking a Test

**Steps**:

1. **Start Test**:

   - When a candidate begins a test, create a new record in `testSubmissions` linked to their `testAssignment`.
   - Update `status` in `testAssignments` to "in_progress".
   - Record `startedAt`.
2. **Display Questions**:

   - Fetch questions from `questions` table, applying `randomizedQuestions` and `randomizedOptions` if enabled.
3. **Answer Questions**:

   - As the candidate answers, insert records into the `answers` table capturing their responses.
4. **Submit Test**:

   - Upon submission, update `testSubmissions` with `submittedAt`, calculate `duration`, and update `status` to "submitted".
   - Update `testAssignments` `status` to "completed".

**Example**:

```typescript
// Candidate starts the test
const submission = {
  assignmentId: assignmentId,
  startedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: "submitted", // Initially submitted upon completion
};

const submissionId = await db.insert("testSubmissions", submission);

// Updating test assignment status
await db.update("testAssignments", assignmentId, { 
  status: "in_progress", 
  attemptCount: 1, 
  lastAttemptAt: new Date().toISOString(),
});

// Recording answers
const answer = {
  submissionId: submissionId,
  questionId: questionId,
  selectedOptionIds: [option1.optionId],
  isCorrect: true,
  pointsAwarded: 5.0,
  answeredAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};

await db.insert("answers", answer);

// Finalizing submission
await db.update("testSubmissions", submissionId, {
  submittedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  duration: 3600, // e.g., 1 hour in seconds
  status: "submitted",
});

await db.update("testAssignments", assignmentId, {
  status: "completed",
});
```

### D. Grading and Feedback

**Steps**:

1. **Automatic Grading**:

   - For objective questions (MCQ, MSQ, TrueFalse), compare `selectedOptionIds` with correct options (`isCorrect`).
   - Update `answers` with `isCorrect` and `pointsAwarded`.
   - Calculate total `score` in `testSubmissions`.
2. **Manual Grading**:

   - For subjective questions (Essay, Coding), evaluators review responses.
   - Update `answers` with `isCorrect` and `pointsAwarded`.
   - Provide feedback in `testSubmissions`.
3. **Finalize Grading**:

   - Update `testSubmissions` `status` to "graded" or "reviewed".
   - Notify candidates of their results via the `notifications` system.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Automatic grading for an MCQ
const selectedOptions = await db.query("options", { 
  optionId: { $in: selectedOptionIds },
});

const correctOptions = selectedOptions.filter(option => option.isCorrect);

const isCorrect = correctOptions.length === selectedOptionIds.length &&
                  selectedOptionIds.every(id => correctOptions.some(opt => opt.optionId === id));

const pointsAwarded = isCorrect ? question.points : 0;

// Update answer record
await db.update("answers", answerId, {
  isCorrect: isCorrect,
  pointsAwarded: pointsAwarded,
});

// Calculate total score
const totalScore = await db.query("answers", { 
  submissionId: submissionId 
}).then(answers => 
  answers.reduce((sum, ans) => sum + (ans.pointsAwarded || 0), 0)
);

// Update test submission
await db.update("testSubmissions", submissionId, {
  score: totalScore,
  status: "graded",
});

// Notify candidate
const notification = {
  userId: candidateId,
  type: "test_graded",
  referenceId: submissionId,
  referenceType: "testSubmissions",
  fromUserId: adminUserId,
  metadata: {
    message: `Your test "${testTitle}" has been graded. Your score is ${totalScore}.`,
    actionUrl: `/tests/${testId}/results`,
  },
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  isRead: false,
};

await db.insert("notifications", notification);
```

### E. Proctoring

**Steps**:

1. **Initiate Proctoring Session**:

   - When a candidate starts a test, create a `proctoringSessions` record linked to their `testSubmission`.
2. **Record Activities**:

   - Continuously capture candidate activities (e.g., screen captures, webcam snapshots) and store them in the `activities` array.
3. **Terminate Session**:

   - Upon test completion or timeout, update the `proctoringSessions` record with `endedAt`.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Starting a proctoring session
const proctoringSession = {
  submissionId: submissionId,
  proctorId: proctorUserId,
  startedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  activities: [],
};

const sessionId = await db.insert("proctoringSessions", proctoringSession);

// Recording an activity
const activity = {
  activityType: "screen_capture",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  metadata: {
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/screenshots/12345.png",
  },
};

// Append activity to the session
await db.update("proctoringSessions", sessionId, { 
  activities: db.arrayAppend("activities", activity),
});

// Ending the session
await db.update("proctoringSessions", sessionId, { 
  endedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

### F. Reporting and Analytics

**Steps**:

1. **Aggregate Data**:

   - Use aggregated queries to calculate metrics like average scores, pass rates, question difficulty, etc.
2. **Generate Reports**:

   - Create reports for administrators to assess candidate performance and test effectiveness.
3. **Export Data**:

   - Provide options to export data in formats like CSV or PDF for offline analysis.

**Example**:

```typescript
// Calculating average score for a test
const submissions = await db.query("testSubmissions", { testId: testId });

const averageScore = submissions.reduce((sum, sub) => sum + (sub.score || 0), 0) / submissions.length;

// Finding question difficulty (percentage correct)
const questions = await db.query("questions", { testId: testId });

const questionDifficulty = {};

for (const question of questions) {
  const answers = await db.query("answers", { questionId: question.questionId });
  const correctCount = answers.filter(ans => ans.isCorrect).length;
  const total = answers.length;
  questionDifficulty[question.questionText] = total > 0 ? (correctCount / total) * 100 : 0;
}

// Preparing report data
const report = {
  averageScore: averageScore,
  questionDifficulty: questionDifficulty,
};

// Exporting report (pseudo-code)
exportToCSV(report, "test_report.csv");
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

### 1. Scalability

- **Indexes**:

  - **Implement Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields such as `testId`, `candidateId`, `questionId`, and `submissionId` to enhance query performance.
  - **Composite Indexes**: For queries involving multiple fields, consider composite indexes.
- **Partitioning**:

  - **Large Tables**: For tables like `answers` and `testSubmissions`, consider partitioning based on time (e.g., monthly) to manage large datasets efficiently.

### 2. Security

- **Data Validation**:

  - **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks and maintain data integrity.
- **Access Control**:

  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement roles (e.g., Admin, Proctor, Candidate) with specific permissions to restrict who can create, modify, or view tests and submissions.
- **Encryption**:

  - **Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data, such as candidate information and proctoring logs, to protect against unauthorized access.
  - **Data in Transit**: Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to encrypt data being transmitted between clients and the server.

### 3. Data Integrity

- **Foreign Key Constraints**:

  - **Referential Integrity**: Ensure that foreign keys (`testId`, `sectionId`, etc.) correctly reference existing records to prevent orphaned entries.
- **Transactions**:

  - **Atomic Operations**: Use transactions for operations involving multiple table updates to maintain consistency. For example, assigning a test to a candidate involves updating both `testAssignments` and creating a `testSubmissions` record.

### 4. Flexibility

- **Dynamic Question Types**:

  - **Support Various Formats**: By accommodating different question types (MCQ, Essay, Coding), the system can cater to diverse assessment needs.
- **Reusable Components**:

  - **Question Banks**: Utilize `questionBanks` and `tags` to promote the reuse of questions across multiple tests, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.

### 5. Version Control

- **Test Versions**:

  - **Maintain Versions**: Use `testVersion` to manage updates to tests without affecting ongoing assignments. This allows for historical tracking and rollback if necessary.
- **Question Versions**:

  - **Track Changes**: Similarly, track versions of questions to manage updates and ensure that changes do not disrupt existing tests.

### 6. Backup and Recovery

- **Regular Backups**:

  - **Data Protection**: Implement automated backups of the database to prevent data loss.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**:

  - **Recovery Strategy**: Develop a plan to restore data in case of failures, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.
